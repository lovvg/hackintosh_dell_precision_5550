## How to disable CFG Lock

This is specific to XPS 15 9500 only (along with its sibling models and previous gen).

Select the modGRUBShell option at startup (OpenCore boot selection page).
At the grub prompt, enter the following commands (the first line unlocks CFG, the second line unlocks overclocking).

```
setup_var CpuSetup 0x3e 0x0
setup_var CpuSetup 0xda 0x0
exit
```

Restart your laptop and boot into the BIOS. Do a factory reset. Now your CFG lock will be disabled. You can confirm that by running the VerifyMSR2 option.

If you update your BIOS, you may need to do this again but so far Dell has been kind to us.
